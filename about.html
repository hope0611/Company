      <h3>WHO WE ARE </h3><br/>
      <p>The creative collective 'Studio Create' was established in 2017 by individuals from various artistic and professional backgrounds. </p>
 
<p> Studio Create's vision is realized through the pursuit of a wide range of creative outlets without limitation. Each member recognizes the responsibility they have in regards to both their personal ambitions as well as the collective instincts of the Studio Create group, and through diverse projects are constantly applying and developing their creative processes with respect to the social and human significance of art.
 
With this in mind, the creatives of Studio Create strive to form an intimate and continuous dialogue with the public through an inclusive artistic approach, which encompasses a wide array of fields and interests. The group's involvement in different artistic practices encourages networking between individuals involved in various outlets such as two-dimensional art, photography, sculpture, design, art directing, creative consulting. Studio Create also considers the importance of quality collaborative efforts between independent artists and corporate entities, building a healthy support system for the future generation of creatives, non-profit public art ventures, and actively responding to the inner and outer aspirations and sensibilities of creativity in modern society.
